            <h3>Programmer!</h3>
            <p>My name is Sadab. Born on a dark and stormy night on October 14, 2010, in the bustling city of Dhaka, my life has been filled with twists and turns. My family later moved to the quiet town of Naogaon when I was just three years old, and that's where my journey truly began.

                At the tender age of five, my father enrolled me in BIAM Laboratory School and College, and I'll never forget that first day. As I walked through the towering gates, a sense of unease settled in my stomach. The school was unlike anything I had ever seen before, with eerie statues and mysterious symbols adorning the walls. But it wasn't long before I met my new friends, and they helped me adjust to my strange new surroundings.
                
                Little did I know that those surroundings were anything but ordinary. As the years went by, I witnessed things that seemed straight out of a sci-fi movie or horror film. I saw incredible powers and heard tales of unbelievable creatures that lurked in the shadows. At first, I didn't believe any of it, but as I delved deeper into the mysteries of my new home, I began to understand that there was more to the world than met the eye.
                
                As I grew older, I became obsessed with solving problems and facing challenges. I taught myself programming, and before long, I was creating software that would have made even the most brilliant minds envious. But I didn't stop there. I had a thirst for knowledge, and I wanted to learn everything I could about the world of computer science.
                
                I researched the fourth industrial revolution, studying everything from machine learning to data science to neural networks. I knew that if I wanted to succeed, I needed to be the best. And so, I made a plan. In my first year of college, I would master the most in-demand programming languages and become a junior software engineer. In my second year, I would tackle more advanced subjects like data structures, algorithms, and machine learning. And then, armed with my degrees and my incredible skills, I would apply for jobs at the biggest software companies in the world.
                
                But little did I know that my journey was just beginning. As I dug deeper into the mysteries of computer science, I uncovered a dark secret lurking beneath the surface. There were those who would do anything to keep their power, and they would stop at nothing to silence anyone who stood in their way. I found myself embroiled in a dangerous game of cat and mouse, pursued by shadowy figures who would stop at nothing to silence me.
                
                But I refused to back down. With every passing day, my skills grew stronger, and my determination burned brighter. I would not be silenced. I would not be stopped. And in the end, I emerged victorious, a true champion of the digital age.
                
                So now, as I look back on my life, I know that I have achieved greatness. I have faced challenges that would have crushed lesser men and emerged victorious. I have unlocked the secrets of the universe, and I have shown the world what it means to be truly great. And I know that no matter what comes my way, I will always be ready, always be prepared, and always be unstoppable.</p>
